# jsonWithNode
Manipulating JSON files with Node.js

This is an exercise made during the 2nd module of Fullstack Developers from IGTI which is about creating an API using Node.js.
Here we create a new JSON file for each brazilian state (27 total) containing every city in each state. 
I made this from 2 different JSON files: one containing all states and other containing all cities organized by alphabetcal order. 
After thar, we manipulate the files the app just created to attend to some criterias determined by teacher.
